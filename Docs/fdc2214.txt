3 Description

Capacitive  sensing  is  a  low-power,  high-resolution 
contactless  sensing  technique  that  can  be  applied 
to  a  variety  of  applications  ranging  from  proximity 
detection  and  gesture  recognition  to  remote  liquid 
level  sensing.  The  sensor  in  a  capacitive  sensing 
system is any metal or conductor, allowing for a highly 
flexible system design.

The  main  challenge  limiting  sensitivity  in  capacitive 
sensing  applications  is  noise  susceptibility  of  the 
sensors.  With 
resonant  sensing 
architecture,  performance  can  be  maintained  even  in 
the presence of fluorescent light.

the  FDC2x1x 

family  of 
is  a  multi-channel 
The  FDC2x1x 
high-speed 
capacitance-to-digital 
high-resolution, 
converters 
implementing  capacitive  sensing 
for 
solutions.  The  devices  employ  an  innovative  narrow-
band  based  architecture  to  offer  high  rejection  of 
out  of  band  noise  while  providing  high  resolution  at 
high  speed.  The  devices  support  a  wide  excitation 
frequency  range,  offering  flexibility  in  system  design. 
A  wide  frequency  range  is  especially  useful  for 
reliable  sensing  of  conductive 
liquids  such  as 
detergent, soap, and ink.

The  FDC221x  is  optimized  for  high  resolution,  up 
to  28  bits,  while  the  FDC211x  offers  a  fast  sample 
rate  of  up  to  13.3kSPS  for  easy  implementation 
of  applications  that  use  fast  moving  targets.  The 
large  maximum  input  capacitance  of  250nF  allows 
for  the  use  of  remote  sensors,  as  well  as  for 
tracking  environmental  changes  over  time  such  as 
temperature and humidity.

The  FDC2x1x  family  targets  proximity  sensing  and 
liquid level sensing applications for any type of liquids. 
For  non-conductive  liquid  level  sensing  applications 
in  the  presence  of  interferences  such  as  human 
hands,  the  FDC1004  is  recommended  and  features 
integrated active shield drivers.

Electrical Characteristics values apply only for factory testing conditions at the temperature indicated. Factory testing conditions result 
in very limited self-heating of the device such that TJ = TA. No guarantee of parametric performance is indicated in the electrical tables 
under conditions of internal self-heating where TJ > TA. Absolute Maximum Ratings indicate junction temperature limits beyond which 
the device can be permanently degraded, either mechanically or electrically.

values have no prefix.
Limits are ensured by testing, design, or statistical analysis at 25°C. Limits over the operating temperature range are ensured through 
correlations using statistical quality control (SQC) method.

7 Detailed Description
7.1 Overview

FDC2212, FDC2214, FDC2112, FDC2114
SNOSCZ5B – JUNE 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2024

The  FDC2112,  FDC2114,  FDC2212,  and  FDC2214  are  high-resolution,  multichannel  capacitance-to-digital 
converters  for  implementing  capacitive  sensing  solutions.  In  contrast  to  traditional  switched-capacitance 
architectures, the FDC2112, FDC2114, FDC2212, and FDC2214 employ an L-C resonator, also known as L-C 
tank, as a sensor. The narrow-band architecture allows unprecedented EMI immunity and greatly reduced noise 
floor when compared to other capacitive sensing solutions.

Using  this  approach,  a  change  in  capacitance  of  the  L-C  tank  can  be  observed  as  a  shift  in  the  resonant 
frequency. Using this principle, the FDC is a capacitance-to-digital converter (FDC) that measures the oscillation 
frequency of an LC resonator. The device outputs a digital value that is proportional to frequency. This frequency 
measurement can be converted to an equivalent capacitance

The FDC is composed of front-end resonant circuit drivers, followed by a multiplexer that sequences through the 
active channels, connecting them to the core that measures and digitizes the sensor frequency (fSENSOR). The 
core uses a reference frequency (fREF) to measure the sensor frequency. fREF is derived from either an internal 
reference clock (oscillator), or an externally supplied clock. The digitized output for each channel is proportional 
to the ratio of fSENSOR/fREF. The I2C interface is used to support device configuration and to transmit the digitized 
frequency values to a host processor. The FDC can be placed in shutdown mode, saving current, using the SD 
pin. The INTB pin can be configured to notify the host of changes in system status.

Figure 7-3 shows the clock dividers and multiplexers of the FDC.

Figure 7-3. Clocking Diagram

In  Figure  7-3,  the  key  clocks  are  fIN,  fREF,  and  fCLK.  fCLK  is  selected  from  either  the  internal  clock  source  or 
external  clock  source  (CLKIN)  .  The  frequency  measurement  reference  clock,  fREF,  is  derived  from  the  fCLK 
source.  TI  recommends  that  precision  applications  use  an  external  controller  clock  that  offers  the  stability  and 
accuracy requirements needed for the application. The internal oscillator can be used in applications that require 
low  cost  and  do  not  require  high  precision.  The  fINx  clock  is  derived  from  sensor  frequency  for  a  channel  x, 
fSENSORx.  fREFx  and  fINx  must  meet  the  requirements  listed  in  Table  7-1,  depending  on  whether  fCLK  (controller 
clock) is the internal or external clock.

7.3.2 Multi-Channel and Single-Channel Operation

The  multi-channel  package  of  the  FDC  enables  the  user  to  save  board  space  and  support  flexible  system 
design.  For  example,  temperature  drift  can  often  cause  a  shift  in  component  values,  resulting  in  a  shift  in 
resonant frequency of the sensor. Using a second sensor as a reference provides the capability to cancel out a 
temperature shift. When operated in multi-channel mode, the FDC sequentially samples the active channels. In 
single-channel mode, the FDC samples a single channel, which is selectable. Table 7-3 shows the registers and 
values that are used to configure either multi-channel or single-channel modes.

A DATA value of 0x0000000 = under range for FDC2212/FDC2214.
A DATA value of 0xFFFFFFF = over range for FDC2212/FDC2214.

When the FDC sequences through the channels in multi-channel mode, the dwell time interval for each channel 
is the sum of three parts:
1. sensor activation time
2. conversion time
3. channel switch delay

The sensor activation time is the amount of settling time required for the sensor oscillation to stabilize, as shown 
in Figure 7-4. The settling wait time is programmable, and TI recommends setting the wait time to a value that is 
long enough to allow stable oscillation. The settling wait time for channel x is given by:

tSx = (CHX_SETTLECOUNTˣ16)/fREFx

(3)

Table 7-5 illustrates the registers and values for configuring the settling time for each channel.

(1) Channels 2 and 3 are available only in the FDC2114 and FDC2214.
fREFx is the reference frequency configured for the channel.
(2)

The SETTLECOUNT for any channel x must satisfy:

•

CHx_SETTLECOUNT > Vpk × fREFx × C × π2 / (32 × IDRIVEX)

• – where

– Vpk = Peak oscillation amplitude at the programmed IDRIVE setting
– fREFx = Reference frequency for Channel x
– C = sensor capacitance including parasitic PCB capacitance
– IDRIVEX = setting programmed into the IDRIVE register in amps

(4)

• Round the result to the next highest integer (for example, if Equation 4 recommends a minimum value of 

6.08, program the register to 7 or higher).

• The conversion time represents the number of reference clock cycles used to measure the sensor frequency 

and is set by the CHx_RCOUNT register for the channel. The conversion time for any channel x is:

•

tCx = (CHx_RCOUNT ˣ 16 + 4) /fREFx

(5)

• The reference count value must be chosen to support the required number of effective bits (ENOB). For 

example, if an ENOB of 13 bits is required, then a minimum conversion time of 213 = 8192 clock cycles is 
required. 8192 clock cycles correspond to a CHx_RCOUNT value of 0x0200.

The typical channel switch delay time between the end of conversion and the beginning of sensor activation of 
the subsequent channel is:

Channel Switch Delay = 692ns + 5 / fref

(6)

The  deterministic  conversion  time  of  the  FDC  allows  data  polling  at  a  fixed  interval.  For  example,  if  the 
programmed RCOUNT setting is 512 FREF cycles and SETTLECOUNT is 128 FREF cycles, then one conversion 
takes  1.8ms  (sensor-activation  time)  +  3.2ms  (conversion  time)  +  0.75ms  (channel-switch  delay)  =  16.75ms 
per  channel.  If  the  FDC  is  configured  for  dual-channel  operation  by  setting  AUTOSCAN_EN  =  1  and 
RR_SEQUENCE = 00, then one full set of conversion results are available from the data registers every 33.5ms.

A  data  ready  flag  (DRDY)  is  also  available  for  interrupt  driven  system  designs  (see  the  STATUS  register 
description in Register Maps).

7.3.3 Gain and Offset (FDC2112, FDC2114 Only)

The FDC2112 and FDC2114 have internal 16-bit data converters, but the standard conversion output word width 
is only 12 bits; therefore only 12 of the 16 bits are available from the data registers. By default, the gain feature is 
disabled and the DATA registers contain the 12 MSBs of the 16-bit word. However, it is possible to shift the data

output by up to 4 bits. Figure 7-6 illustrates the segment of the 16-bit sample that is reported for each possible 
gain setting.

Figure 7-6. Conversion Data Output Gain

For  systems  in  which  the  sensor  signal  variation  is  less  than  25%  of  the  full-scale  range,  the  FDC  can  report 
conversion  results  with  higher  resolution  by  setting  the  Output  Gain.  The  Output  Gain  is  applied  to  all  device 
channels.  An  output  gain  can  be  used  to  apply  a  2-bit,  3-bit,  or  4-bit  shift  to  the  output  code  for  all  channels, 
allowing access to the 4 LSBs of the original 16-bit result. The MSBs of the sample are shifted out when a gain is 
applied. Do not use the output gain if the MSBs of any active channel are toggling, as the MSBs for that channel 
are lost when gain is applied.

Example: If the conversion result for a channel is 0x07A3, with OUTPUT_GAIN=0x0, the reported output code 
is  0x07A.  If  OUTPUT_GAIN  is  set  to  0x3  in  the  same  condition,  then  the  reported  output  code  is  0x7A3.  The 
original 4 MSBs (0x0) are no longer accessible.

An offset value can be subtracted from each DATA value to compensate for a frequency offset or maximize the 
dynamic  range  of  the  sample  data.  Make  sure  the  offset  values  <  fSENSORx_MIN  /  fREFx.  Otherwise,  the  offset 
might be so large that the offset masks the LSBs which are changing.

The CHx_IDRIVE field should be programmed such that the sensor oscillates at an amplitude between 1.2Vpk 
(VSENSORMIN) and 1.8Vpk (VSENSORMAX). An IDRIVE value of 00000 corresponds to 16µA, and IDRIVE = b11111 
corresponds to 1563µA.

A high sensor current drive mode can be enabled to drive sensor coils with > 1.5mA on channel 0, only in single 
channel mode. This feature can be used when the sensor minimum recommended oscillation amplitude of 1.2V 
cannot be achieved with the highest IDRIVE setting. Set the HIGH_CURRENT_DRV register bit to b1 to enable 
this mode.

used to configure status reporting 
[ 15:0 ]

Refer to Register Maps section 
for a description of the individual 
error configuration bits.

(1) Channels 2 and 3 are available for FDC2114 and FDC2114 only.

See the STATUS and STATUS_CONFIG register description in the Register Map section. These registers can be 
configured to trigger an interrupt on the INTB pin for certain events. The following conditions must be met:

1. The error or status register must be unmasked by enabling the appropriate register bit in the 

STATUS_CONFIG register

2. The INTB function must be enabled by setting CONFIG.INTB_DIS to 0

When a bit field in the STATUS register is set, the entire STATUS register content is held until read or until the 
DATA_CHx register is read. Reading also deasserts INTB.

Interrupts are cleared by one of the following events:

1. Entering Sleep Mode
2. Power-on reset (POR)
3. Device enters Shutdown Mode (SD is asserted)
4. S/W reset
5.

I2C read of the STATUS register: Reading the STATUS register clears any error status bit set in STATUS 
along with the ERR_CHAN field and deassert INTB

Setting register CONFIG.INTB_DIS to b1 disables the INTB function and holds the INTB pin high.

7.3.6 Input Deglitch Filter

www.ti.com

The  input  deglitch  filter  suppresses  EMI  and  ringing  above  the  sensor  frequency.  The  input  deglitch  filter 
does  not  impact  the  conversion  result  as  long  as  the  bandwidth  is  configured  to  be  above  the  maximum 
sensor  frequency.  The  input  deglitch  filter  can  be  configured  in  MUX_CONFIG.DEGLITCH  register  field  as 
shown  in  Table  7-11.  For  optimal  performance,  TI  recommends  to  select  the  lowest  setting  that  exceeds 
the  sensor  oscillation  frequency.  For  example,  if  the  maximum  sensor  frequency  is  2.0MHz,  choose 
MUX_CONFIG.DEGLITCH = b100 (3.3MHz).

When  the  FDC  powers  up,  the  FDC  enters  into  Sleep  Mode  and  waits  for  configuration.  When  the  device  is 
configured, exit Sleep Mode by setting CONFIG.SLEEP_MODE_EN to b0.

TI recommends to configure the FDC while in Sleep Mode. If a setting on the FDC needs to be changed, return 
the device to Sleep Mode, change the appropriate register, and then exit Sleep Mode.

7.4.2 Normal (Conversion) Mode

When  operating  in  the  normal  (conversion)  mode,  the  FDC  is  periodically  sampling  the  frequency  of  the 
sensor(s) and generating sample outputs for the active channel(s).

7.4.3 Sleep Mode

Sleep  Mode  is  entered  by  setting  the  CONFIG.SLEEP_MODE_EN  register  field  to  1.  While  in  this  mode,  the 
register  contents  are  maintained.  To  exit  Sleep  Mode,  set  the  CONFIG.SLEEP_MODE_EN  register  field  to  0. 
After  setting  CONFIG.SLEEP_MODE_EN  to  b0,  sensor  activation  for  the  first  conversion  begins  after  16,384 
fINT  clock  cycles.  While  in  Sleep  Mode  the  I2C  interface  is  functional  so  that  register  reads  and  writes  can  be 
performed.  While  in  Sleep  Mode,  no  conversions  are  performed.  In  addition,  entering  Sleep  Mode  clears  any 
error condition and deassert the INTB pin.

7.4.4 Shutdown Mode

When the SD pin is set to high, the FDC enters Shutdown Mode. Shutdown Mode is the lowest power state. To 
exit Shutdown Mode, set the SD pin to low. Entering Shutdown Mode returns all registers to the default states.

While in Shutdown Mode, no conversions are performed. In addition, entering Shutdown Mode clears any error 
condition and deassert the INTB pin. While the device is in Shutdown Mode, is not possible to read to or write 
from the device via the I2C interface.

7.4.4.1 Reset

The FDC can be reset by writing to RESET_DEV.RESET_DEV. Conversion stops and all register values return 
to the default values. This register bit always returns 0b when read.

7.5 Programming

The FDC device uses an I2C interface to access control and data registers.

7.5.1 I2C Interface Specifications

The FDC uses an extended start sequence with I2C for register access. The maximum speed of the I2C interface 
is 400kbps. This sequence follows the standard I2C 7-bit target address followed by an 8-bit pointer register byte

to set the register address. When the ADDR pin is set low, the FDC I2C address is 0x2A; when the ADDR pin 
is set high, the FDC I2C address is 0x2B. The ADDR pin must not change state after the FDC exits Shutdown 
Mode.

8 Application and Implementation

Note

FDC2212, FDC2214, FDC2112, FDC2114
SNOSCZ5B – JUNE 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2024

Information  in  the  following  applications  sections  is  not  part  of  the  TI  component  specification, 
and  TI  does  not  warrant  its  accuracy  or  completeness.  TI’s  customers  are  responsible  for 
determining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design 
implementation to confirm system functionality.

8.1 Application Information
8.1.1 Sensor Configuration

The  FDC  supports  two  sensor  configurations.  Both  configurations  use  an  LC  tank  to  set  the  frequency  of 
oscillation. A typical choice is an 18 μH shielded SMD inductor in parallel with a 33pF capacitor, which result in 
a 6.5MHz oscillation frequency. In the single-ended configuration in Figure 8-1, a conductive plate is connected 
IN0A. Together with a target object, the conductive plate forms a variable capacitor.

Figure 8-1. Single-Ended Sensor Configuration

In the differential sensor configuration in Figure 8-2, one conductive plate is connected to IN0A, and a second 
conductive  plate  is  connected  to  IN0B.  Together,  they  form  a  variable  capacitor.  When  using  an  single-ended 
sensor configuration, set CHx_FIN_SEL to b10 (divide by 2).

Figure 8-2. Differential Sensor Configuration

The  single-ended  configuration  allows  higher  sensing  range  than  the  differential  configuration  for  a  given 
total  sensor  plate  area.  In  applications  in  which  high  sensitivity  at  close  proximity  is  desired,  the  differential 
configuration performs better than the single-ended configuration.

8.1.2 Shield

in order to minimize interference from external objects, some applications require an additional plate which acts 
as a shield. The shield can either be:

• actively driven shield: The shield is a buffered signal of the INxA pin. The signal is buffered by an external 

amplifier with a gain of 1.

• passive shield: The shield is connected to GND. Adding a passive shield decreases sensitivity of the sensor, 
but is dependent on the distance between the distance between the sensing plate and the shield. Adjust the 
distance between the sensing plate and the shield to achieve the required sensitivity

8.1.3 Power-Cycled Applications

For  applications  which  do  not  require  high  sample  rates  or  maximum  conversion  resolution,  the  total  active 
conversion  time  of  the  FDC  can  be  minimized  to  reduce  power  consumption.  This  can  be  done  by  either  by 
using sleep mode or shutdown mode during times in which conversions are not required (see Device Functional 
Modes).

As  an  example,  for  an  application  which  only  needs  10  samples  per  second  with  a  resolution  of  16  bits  can 
utilize the low-power modes. The sensor requires SETTLECOUNT = 16 and IDRIVE of 01111b (0.146mA). Given 
FREF = 40MHz and RCOUNT = 4096 will provide the resolution required. This corresponds to 4096 * 16 * 10 / 
40MHz  →  16.4ms  of  active  conversion  time  per  second.  Start-up  time  and  channel  switch  delay  account  for 
an additional 0.34ms. For the remainder of the time, the device can be in sleep mode: Therefore, the average 
current is 19.4ms * 3.6mA active current + 980.6ms of 35µA of sleep current, which is approximately 104.6µA of 
average supply current. Sleep mode retains register settings and therefore requires less I2C writes to wake up 
the FDC than shutdown mode.

Greater current savings can be realized by use of shutdown mode during inactive periods. In shutdown mode, 
device configuration is not retained, and so the device must be configured for each sample. For this example, 
configuring each sample takes approximately  1.2ms (13 registers * 92.5 µs per register). The total active time 
is  20.6ms.  The  average  current  is  20ms  *  3.6mA  active  current  +  980ms  *  2µA  of  shutdown  current,  which  is 
approximately 75µA of average supply current.

8.1.4 Inductor Self-Resonant Frequency

Every  inductor  has  a  distributed  parasitic  capacitance,  which  is  dependent  on  construction  and  geometry. 
At  the  Self-Resonant  Frequency  (SRF),  the  reactance  of  the  inductor  cancels  the  reactance  of  the  parasitic 
capacitance.  Above  the  SRF,  the  inductor  electrically  appears  to  be  a  capacitor.  Because  the  parasitic 
capacitance is not well-controlled or stable, TI recommends that fSENSOR < 0.8 × fSR.

Figure 8-3. Example Coil Inductance vs Frequency

The  example  inductor  in  Figure  8-3,  has  a  SRF  at  6.38MHz;  therefore  do  not  operate  the  inductor  above 
0.8×6.38MHz, or 5.1MHz.

8.1.5 Application Curves

8.2 Typical Application

The  FDC  can  be  used  to  measure  liquid  level  in  non-conductive  containers.  Due  to  very  high  excitation 
rate  capability,  the  FDC  is  able  to  measure  soapy  water,  ink,  soap,  and  other  conductive  liquids.  Capacitive 
sensors can be attached to the outside of the container or be located remotely from the container, allowing for 
contactless measurements.

The  working  principle  is  based  on  a  ratiometric  measurement;  Figure  8-8  shows  a  possible  system 
implementation  which  uses  three  electrodes.  The  Level  electrode  provides  a  capacitance  value  proportional 
to  the  liquid  level.  The  Reference  Environmental  electrode  and  the  Reference  Liquid  electrode  are  used  as 
references. The Reference Liquid electrode accounts for the liquid dielectric constant and the variation, while the 
Reference  Environmental  electrode  is  used  to  compensate  for  any  other  environmental  variations  that  are  not 
due to the liquid itself. Note that the Reference Environmental electrode and the Reference Liquid electrode are 
the same physical size (hREF).

For  this  application,  single-ended  measurements  on  the  active  channels  are  appropriate,  as  the  tank  is 
grounded. Use Equation to determine the liquid level from the measured capacitances:

• CRE is the capacitance of the Reference Environmental electrode,
• CRL is the capacitance of the Reference Liquid electrode,
• CLev is the current value of the capacitance measured at the Level electrode sensor,
• CLev(0) is the capacitance of the Level electrode when the container is empty, and
• hREF is the height in the desired units of the Container or Liquid Reference electrodes.

The  ratio  between  the  capacitance  of  the  level  and  the  reference  electrodes  allows  simple  calculation  of  the 
liquid level inside the container itself. Very high sensitivity values (that is, many LSB/mm) can be obtained due 
to  the  high  resolution  of  the  FDC2x1x,  even  when  the  sensors  are  located  remotely  from  the  container.  Note 
that  this  approach  assumes  that  the  container  has  a  uniform  cross  section  from  top  to  bottom,  so  that  each 
incremental increase or decrease in the liquid represents a change in volume that is directly related to the height 
of the liquid.

8.2.1 Schematic

Figure 8-8. FDC (Liquid Level Measurement)

8.2.2 Design Requirements

Make  sure  the  liquid  level  measurement  are  independent  of  the  liquid,  which  can  be  achieved  using  the 
3-electrode  design  described  above.  Moreover,  isolate  the  sensor  from  environmental  interferences  such  as 
a human body, other objects, or EMI.

8.2.3 Detailed Design Procedure

In  capacitive  sensing  systems,  the  design  of  the  sensor  plays  an  important  role  in  determining  system 
performance  and  capabilities.  In  most  cases  the  sensor  is  simply  a  metal  plate  that  can  be  designed  on  the 
PCB.

The  sensor  used  in  this  example  is  implemented  with  a  two-layer  PCB.  On  the  top  layer,  which  faces  the 
tank,  there  are  the  3  electrodes  (Reference  Environmental,  Reference  Liquid,  and  Level)  with  a  ground  plane 
surrounding the electrodes.

SNOSCZ5B – JUNE 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2024

Depending on the shape of the container, the FDC can be located on the sensor PCB to minimize the length of 
the traces between the input channels and the sensors. In case the shape of the container or other mechanical 
constraints  do  not  allow  having  the  sensors  and  the  FDC  on  the  same  PCB,  the  traces  which  connect  the 
channels to the sensor need to be shielded with the appropriate shield.

8.2.3.1 Recommended Initial Register Configuration Values

The application requires 100SPS ( TSAMPLE = 10ms). A sensor with an 18µH inductor and a 33pF capacitor is 
used. Additional pin, trace, and wire capacitance accounts for 20pF, so the total capacitance is 53pF.

Using  L  and  C,  fSENSOR  =  1/2π√(LC)  =  1/2π√(18*10-6  *  50*10-12)  =  5.15MHz.  This  represents  the  maximum 
sensor frequency. When the sensor capacitance is added, the frequency decreases.

Using a system controller clock of 40MHz applied to the CLKIN pin allows flexibility for setting the internal clock 
frequencies.  The  sensor  coils  are  connected  to  channel  0  (IN0A  and  IN0B  pins),  channel  1  (IN1A  and  IN1B 
pins), and channel 2 (IN2A and IN2B pins).

After  powering  on  the  FDC,  the  FDC  enters  Sleep  Mode.  Program  the  registers  as  follows  (example  sets 
registers for channel 0 only; channel 1 and channel 2 registers can use equivalent configuration):

1. Set the dividers for channel 0.

a. The sensor is in an single-ended configuration, therefore set the sensor frequency select register to 2, 

which means setting field CH0_FIN_SELto b10.

b. The design constraint for fREF0 is > 4 × fSENSOR. To satisfy this constraint, fREF0 must be greater than 
20.6MHz, so set the reference divider to 1. This is done by setting the CH0_FREF_DIVIDER field to 
0x01.

c. The combined value for Chan. 0 divider register (0x14) is 0x2001.

2. Sensor drive current: to ensure that the oscillation amplitude is between 1.2V and 1.8V, measure the 

oscillation amplitude on an oscilloscope and adjust the IDRIVE value, or use the integrated FDC GUI feature 
to determine the optimal setting. In this case, set the IDRIVE value to 15 (decimal), which results in an 
oscillation amplitude of 1.68V(pk). Set the INIT_DRIVE current field to 0x00. The combined value for the 
DRIVE_CURRENT_CH0 register (addr 0x1E) is 0x7C00.

3. Program the settling time for Channel 0 (see Multi-Channel and Single-Channel Operation).

a. CHx_SETTLECOUNT > Vpk × fREFx × C × π2 / (32 × IDRIVEX) → 7.5, rounded up to 8. To provide 

margin to account for system tolerances, a higher value of 10 is chosen.

b. Program Register 0x10 to a minimum of 10.
c. The settle time is: (10 x 16)/40,000,000 = 4 µs
d. The value for Chan. 0 SETTLECOUNT register (0x10) is 0x000A.

4. The channel switching delay is ~1μs for fREF = 40MHz (see Multi-Channel and Single-Channel Operation)
5. Set the conversion time by the programming the reference count for Channel 0. The budget for the 

conversion time is : 1/N * (TSAMPLE – settling time – channel switching delay) = 1/3 (10,000 – 4 – 1) = 
3.33ms
a. To determine the conversion time register value, use the following equation and solve for 

CH0_RCOUNT: Conversion Time (tC0)= (CH0_RCOUNTˣ16)/fREF0.

b. This results in CH0_RCOUNT having a value of 8329 decimal (rounded down). Note that this yields an 

ENOB > 13 bits.

c. Set the CH0_RCOUNT register (0x08) to 0x2089.

6. Use the default values for the ERROR_CONFIG register (address 0x19). By default, no interrupts are 

enabled

7. Program the MUX_CONFIG register

a. Set the AUTOSCAN_EN to b1 bit to enable sequential mode
b. Set RR_SEQUENCE to b10 to enable data conversion on three channels (channel 0, channel 1, channel 

2)

c. Set DEGLITCH to b101 to set the input deglitch filter bandwidth to 10MHz, the lowest setting that 

exceeds the oscillation tank frequency.

d. The combined value for the MUX_CONFIG register (address 0x1B) is 0xC20D

8. Finally, program the CONFIG register as follows:

a. Set the ACTIVE_CHAN field to b00 to select channel 0.
b. Set SLEEP_MODE_EN field to b0 to enable conversion.
c. Set SENSOR_ACTIVATE_SEL = b0, for full current drive during sensor activation
d. Set the REF_CLK_SRC field to b1 to use the external clock source.
e. Set the other fields to their default values.
f. The combined value for the CONFIG register (address 0x1A) is 0x1601.

We  then  read  the  conversion  results  for  channel  0  to  channel  2  every  10ms  from  register  addresses  0x00  to 
0x05.

Based on the example configuration above, the following register write sequence is recommended:

8.2.4 Application Curve

A  liquid  level  sensor  with  3  electrodes  like  the  one  shown  in  the  schematic  was  connected  to  the  EVM.  The 
plot shows the capacitance measured by Level sensor at different levels of liquid in the tank. The capacitance 
of  the  Reference  Liquid  and  Reference  Environmental  sensors  have  a  steady  value  because  they  experience 
consistent exposure to liquid and air, while the capacitance of the level sensor (Level) increases linearly with the 
height of the liquid in the tank.

SNOSCZ5B – JUNE 2015 – REVISED OCTOBER 2024

Figure 8-9. Electrode Capacitance vs Liquid Level

8.3 Best Design Practices

• Do leave a small gap between sensor plates in differential configurations. TI recommends a 2mm to 3mm 

minimum separation.

• The FDC does not support hot-swapping of the sensors. Do not hot-swap sensors, for example by using 

external multiplexers.

8.4 Power Supply Recommendations

The  FDC  requires  a  voltage  supply  within  2.7V  and  3.6V.  Multilayer  ceramic  bypass  X7R  capacitors  of  0.1μF 
and 1 μF between the VDD and GND pins are recommended. If the supply is located more than a few inches 
from  the  FDC,  additional  bulk  capacitance  can  be  required  in  addition  to  the  ceramic  bypass  capacitors.  An 
electrolytic capacitor with a value of 10μF is a typical choice.

The optimum placement is closest to the VDD and GND pins of the device. Take care to minimize the loop area 
formed by the bypass capacitor connection, the VDD pin, and the GND pin of the device. See Figure 8-10 and 
Figure 8-10 for a layout example.

8.5 Layout
8.5.1 Layout Guidelines

• Avoid long traces to connect the sensor to the FDC. Short traces reduce parasitic capacitances between 

sensor inductor and offer higher system performance.

• Systems that require matched channel response need to have matched trace length on all active channels.

8.5.2 Layout Example

Figure 8-10 to Figure 8-13 show the FDC2114 / FDC2214 evaluation module (EVM) layout.
